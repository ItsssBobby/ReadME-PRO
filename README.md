  ## Description

  This application is to help you create a professional README on the fly and with ease!
  
  [Click Here](https://youtu.be/l8CX9AWLMtc) to watch a video of how it works!

  ## Installation

  Clone the repo and install dependencies using "npm i"

  ## Usage

  Once everything is installed, open your terminal and run "node index.js" and answer the questions the best you can, once you finish the ReadME will be generated in the [generated-README](./generated-README/) file. (there is a test ReadME in there now, the new one will overwrite it!)
